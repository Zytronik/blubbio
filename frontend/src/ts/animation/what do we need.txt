-   animation has a beginning and an end
-   thus also a duration
-   maybe multiple different durations 
        do something 100ms
        followed by 200ms
        trigger this function 
        another animation for 400ms
        trigger function on end
[100, 2000, ]

are css animations entirely different than pixi animations?
